# forest Wallet

This is the reference implementation of [forest's](https://github.com/forestblock/wallet) wallet. It consists of 2 major pieces:

* The forest Wallet APIs, which are intended for use by forest community wallet developers. The wallet APIs can be directly linked into other projects or invoked via a JSON-RPC interface.

* A reference command-line wallet, which provides a baseline wallet for forest and demonstrates how the wallet APIs should be called.

# Usage

To use the command-line wallet, we recommend using the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/forestblock/wallet/releases). There are distributions for Linux, MacOS and Windows.

Full documentation outlining how to use the command line wallet can be found on [forest's Wiki](https://github.com/forestblock/docs/wiki/Wallet-User-Guide)
